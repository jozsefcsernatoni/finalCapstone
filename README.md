Project name: Final Capstone
This project it is the end result of 3 months wasted on the data science course. To be honest I do not understand half of what it does, thanks to the outstanding education provided by HyperionDev. I have took bits of code from various places, made the necessary adjustments, hoping that it will work together. It does.

Installation:
Donwload UsArrests.csv and us.ipynb. The second file is a jupyter notebook. To run it you will need some form of Python, Jupyter Notebook and some libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, PCA, standardascaler,KMeans, scipy and sklearn).

Usage:
After the initial cleansing of the dataset, the data is clustered with KMeans:

Next a dendogram is created:

And Agglomerative clustering performed:

The result is quite similar as the data points are quite close to each other.
